# Titanic data
This project uses Python to conduct exploratory analysis on the titanic dataset, then a Logistic Regression model created from scratch to predict survival given 
a number of variables.


## Tools and Packages

In this project the following tools and Python packages were used:
* **Jupyter Notebooks:** This is the software that lets us run Python code in the browser and intermix markdown with cells containing code.
* **Numpy:** This is Python's main scientific computing library. Its important for Data Science as all libraries in PyData Ecosystem rely on NumPy as one of their main building blocks
* **Pandas:** This is the data analysis tool of choice in Python. It allows fast analysis and data cleaning and preparation using powerful data structures like dataframes and series.
* **Matplotlib:** The data visualisation package of Python. Has a very similar feel to MalLab's graphical plotting and works well with numpy and pandas.
* **Seaborn:**  Statistical plotting library built on top of Matplotlib. It is also designed to work very well with pandas dataframes objects.
* **Scikit-learn:** Although the Logistic Regression model was created from scratch, Scikit-learn was used to compare accuracy against the model created.
